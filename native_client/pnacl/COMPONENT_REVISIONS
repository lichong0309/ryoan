# PNaCl component git revisions. The git base URL and repository names are at
# the top of toolchain_build/toolchain_build_pnacl.py.
# For backward compatibility, the key names match the directory names used by
# gclient in the earlier version of this file, with the exception that
# underscores in this file become dashes in the directory name (that means this
# file can be 'source'ed in a shell script).
#
# You can auto-update this file with ./pnacl/deps_update.py
